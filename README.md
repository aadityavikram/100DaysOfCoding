# 100DaysOfMLCode

This repository is a part of #100DaysofMLCode challenge. That means, I pledge to code machine learning for at least an hour everyday for the next 100 days. Starting from June 20, 2018.

## Day 1-11: June 20-30, 2018

### What I did ?

Learned <b>Linear Algebra</b> from <b>Gilbert Strang</b>'s lectures.

## Day 12: July 1, 2018

### What I did ?

1. Resumed <b>Machine Learning</b> course by <b>Andrew Ng</b> on <b>Coursera</b>.
2. Had completed upto week 4 before.
3. Resumed from week 6.

## Day 13: July 2, 2018

### What I did ?

1. Since it was my birthday, I decided to apply the knowledge that I have gained so far before proceeding further with learning process.
2. Searched for projects and found <b>MNIST Model</b> was the best thing to train to get good hold of concepts as a beginner.

## Day 14: July 3, 2018

### What I did ?

1. Trained the <b>MNIST model</b> for <b>Digit Classification</b>.
2. By Using Tensorflow.
3. Created a neural network model with <b>2 hidden layers</b>, an input layer and an output layer.
4. Achieved accuracy near to about <b>97%</b> after using <b>'Sigmoid'</b> as an activation function.

## Day 15: July 4, 2018

### What I did ?

1. Trained the <b>MNIST model</b> for <b>Digit Classification</b> again but this time I used <b>Convolutional Neural Network</b> or CNN.
2. By Using <b>Tensorflow</b>.
3. Created a neural network model with <b>3 convolutional layers</b>, a <b>fully connected layer</b> and an output layer.
4. Achieved accuracy near to about <b>97.5%</b> after using <b>'Sigmoid'</b> as an activation function and <b>AdamOptimizer</b>.

## Day 16: July 5, 2018

### What I did ?

1. Trained the <b>MNIST model</b> for <b>Digit Classification</b> again but this time I used <b>Convolutional Neural Network</b>.
2. By Using <b>tflearn</b>.
3. Created a neural network model with <b>2 convolutional layers</b>, and <b>2 fully connected layers</b>.
4. Achieved accuracy near to about <b>97.5%</b> after using <b>'Sigmoid'</b> as an activation function.

## Day 17: July 6, 2018

### What I did ?

1. Trained the <b>MNIST model</b> for <b>Digit Classification</b> again but this time I used <b>Recurrent Neural Network</b>.
2. By Using <b>Tensorflow</b>.
3. Created a <b>BasicLSTMCell</b>.
4. Achieved accuracy near to about <b>97.5%</b> after using <b>'Sigmoid'</b> as an activation function and <b>AdamOptimizer</b>.
